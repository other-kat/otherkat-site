A sequence of dance scenes, in preparation of the new kimosphere installation "Transparent Eclipse" by [DAP-Lab][dap], to be premiered at ISEA 2019 in Gwangju, Korea.

It explores impressions of the 2018 moon eclipse and the foraging
for rare mushrooms in degraded forests and deteriorated nature. This dance also spirals around suspended wearables and ASMR. The performers use wearable sensors on their arms and legs.
