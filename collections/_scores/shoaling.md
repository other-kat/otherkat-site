By [Kat Macdonald][kat]

Written for the [London Community Laptop Orchestra][lclo]

Duration: ~10 minutes

Accessibility - <mark>Easy</mark>

*Shoaling* is built as an exercise to encourage creative engagement with standardise tools of playback. The piece emphasises sound as texture, looking at the construction of complex and pulsating textures to find interesting points of alignment and misalignment. 

Each performer is tasked with finding and playing back a sound of waves crashing on a beach. This can either be played on loop or through engagement with a playback tool. It's encourage that one performer starts the performance, with others joining in order of their proximity to the starting player. 

Performers should be distributed amongst the audience to encourage participation. <b>Spread the sounds.</b>

If you do not have a sound ready (or in mind) you can either:

<mark>Find one from the list here!</mark>

or

<mark>Find a sound on <a href="https://freesound.org">https://freesound.org</a> - just make sure to say thank you.</mark>

If your sound is connected to visual content - you are encourage to include the footage on screen for people to see.
