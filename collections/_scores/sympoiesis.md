<h1><i>Sympoiesis</i></h1>

By [Kat Macdonald][kat]

Duration: ~6 minutes

Written for the [Peckham Chamber Orchestra][pco]

Originally conceived as a new ending to *Peter And The Wolf And The Hedgehog*, an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter And The Wolf by myself and [Agnes Cameron][agnes].

This work reimagines the ending to centre on Peter's growth from a self orientated view of the world to an understanding of his placement within an ecosystem. 

Sympoiesis refers to the word coined by [Beth Dempster][sbd] (2000), to describe the way in which ecosystems create, grow and influence each other. The term found greater use when expanded on by [Donna J Haraway][djh] in her talk [“Symbiogenesis, Sympoiesis, and Art Science Activisms for Staying with the Trouble”][ssasaswt] (2016).

The original piece was set to text, matching the rest of the piece, however, this format is presented without the text. Additionally it is presented without precise instructions of entry times and, this is up to the performers but it is generally recommended to stagger entries by at least 1 full repetition.

A full write up of Peter And The Wolf And [The Hedgehog][mr] will be published on [blog.otherkat.com][blog], detailing the full piece, process and the instrumentation we settled on, however, it's recommended to explore playing the work without this reference point.
