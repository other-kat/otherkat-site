By [Kat Macdonald][kat]

Duration: ~7 minutes

Accessibility - <mark>Easy</mark>

<h1>3 6 1 3 4 | 2 2 | x20</h1>

Play things at your own **SLOW** pace. 

Do all you can to avoid syncing up with other players.

Tempo is not set.

If possible consider your breathing in a musical manner, making it audible for some listeners.

An emphasis should be placed on the final beat of the phrase.

One player should be nominated to not play the melody and instead create 'atmosphere'.

Players are invited to carefully add harmonies to the melody, so long as they are within the scale.
