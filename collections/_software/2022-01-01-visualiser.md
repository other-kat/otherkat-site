This software is visualiser that works a bit like tunning a signal to fit the aspect ratio of the built in screen. It's a bit finiky but produces some gorgeous results.

Note: you'll need at least a demo version of <a href="https://cycling74.com/downloads">Max MSP 8</a> or above to open and run the software.
