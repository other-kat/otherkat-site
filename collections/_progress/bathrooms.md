<h1><i>bathrooms (study)</i></h1>

By [Kat Macdonald][kat]

Written in response to the Supreme Court ruling and statements made by the UK government with regards to trans+ peoples access to bathrooms

Stage works in the public bathrooms of institutions that refuse to make statements or make their bathrooms accessible to transgender people.

These works can take the form of <u>photography</u>, <u>performance art</u>, <u>concerts</u>, <u>digital art</u>, <u>web art</u>, <u>exhibitions</u>, <u>posters</u>, <u>literary works</u> and <u>fine art</u>. Within these works there must be a meaningful engagement with the space, either politically, architecturally or conceptually. I am less interested in works that don't present a conflict with these spaces. 

Anyone can partake in this study, with an encouragement for cis participants to focus on riskier disruptive actions, centering the institution as the core audience.

Each work (post evaluation (carried out by an open committee of trans+ artists) that it meets criteria) will be catalogued and archived in the bathroom study archive.

<mark>Prompts</mark>

Host a concert in a bathroom.

Turn a bathroom into an installation.

Write speculative fiction about bathrooms.

Hold an exhibition in a bathrooms.

Gather people within a bathroom.

Occupy a bathroom to prevent standard use.

<mark>Reminders</mark>

Make sure that distruptive actions in public bathrooms, don't affect access to those who need it or target insitutions that ensure trans accessibility. Occupying a bathroom should never prevent access but encourage it. Disruption should be targetted at the instutions upkeep of a 'comfortable' environment, where this contrasts with the inclusivity of the space.
