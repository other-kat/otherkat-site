<h2><i>Work, From Home</i> Solo Exhibition (2023)</h2>

A show exploring intimacy, through space and discomfort. The show contained a retrospective exhibition of <a href="/works/2023-08-01-i-love-or-hate-everyday">I Love Or Hate Everyday</a>, a longform durational piece largerly taking place within the artists home.

Additionally, the piece debuted <a href="/works/2023-12-02-i-want-you-to-haunt-me">i want you to haunt me</a>, a video piece inspired by [Ohiyo by Satoshi Kon][ohiyo] - a one-minute short film that uses transparency layers to convey the monotony of routine. The piece was shown within the environment in which was recorded. Using the nudity, the piece confronts audiences with the discomfort of sitting on the artists bed, watching the ghost of their routine.

Over the course of the night, the artist performed a "hosting" piece,<a href="2023-12-02-i'll-never-look-this-good-again">i'll never look this good again</a>. The piece involved the artist inviting the audience to slowly rip away at her dress, before revealing grey hand prints covering her body. The audience was then invited to slowly, one hand print at a time, wash the artist.

The shows core through line was works focused on introspective intimacy, testing the boundaries of an audiences desire for intimacy with an artist.
