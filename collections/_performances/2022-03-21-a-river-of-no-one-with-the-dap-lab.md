A real-time/live mix telepresence performance by [DAP-Lab][dap]. Available to watch [here][river].

*a river of no one* is a meditation on the current climate crisis, linking regions and continents in a subtle & intimate exploration of “hydrocommons,” a shared ecological water and plant culture that needs to be imagined as a flow in which all life, not just human life, participates.

The new dance/music work showcases dancer/choreographer [Zhi Xu][zhi], based in Bath, UK, along with London-based trans-femme artist, [Kat Macdonald][otherkat], whose work focuses on the expression of transness in modern society through a diverse range of media. The two artists, performing live from their home studios in front of green screens, collaborate with [Johannes Birringer][johan] and [Michèle Danjoux][michele], co-directors of [DAP-Lab (Design and Performance Lab)][dap], also in their studios in London and Leicester. 

Directed by [Johannes Birringer][johan] & [Michèle Danjoux][michele].
Performed by [Kat Macdonald][otherkat] & [Zhi Xu][zhi].
Music by [Kat Macdonald][otherkat] / Choreography by [Zhi Xu][zhi].
Videography by [Johannes Birringer][johan] & [Michèle Danjoux][michele].
