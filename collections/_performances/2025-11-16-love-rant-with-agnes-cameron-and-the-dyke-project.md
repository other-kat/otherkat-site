<h2><i>Love Rant with <a href="https://agnescameron.info/">Agnes Cameron</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thedykeproject/">the Dyke Project</a></i> (2025)</h2>

[Agnes][agnes] and I constructed a series of wind socks for the [Our Ponds][ourpond] [Dyke Project][dykep] action at Hampstead Heath, with the slogans; Trans / Rights,  Learn / Love & Our / Ponds. Additionally, I led a small piece called Love Rant, based on [Julia Serano's essay][juliaserano] of the same name, including some fluxus performance scores distributed to the audience.
