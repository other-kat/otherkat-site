<h2><i>Switched On: Goldberg with <a href="https://agnescameron.info/">Agnes Cameron</a> and <a href="https://www.austinphilemon.com/">Austin Philemon</a> at the <a href="https://www.holytrinitynyc.org/">Holy Trinity Lutheran Church</a></i> (2025)</h2>

A homage to Wendy Carlos' Switched On: Bach developed with Agnes Cameron and Austin Philemon. We debuted Holy Trinity's legendary Bach Vespers programme with our iteraction of Bach's Goldberg Variations. 

Using 4 different synthesisers we tried to apply similar ideas and parameters to how she developed her piece. The core difference was attempting to carry this out live, with an audience, requiring a scoring system for cables and settings to make the transition between variations smooth and quick.
