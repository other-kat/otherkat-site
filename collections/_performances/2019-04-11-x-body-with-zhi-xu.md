"[X-Body][xbody]" is the first large-scale dance work completed for [Zhi Xu’s][zhi] practice-led PhD at Brunel University London. It explores choreographically the qualities that constitute a ‘Chinese dancer-body’, and therefore experiments with how a Chinese dancer-body inhabits/constructs digital/technological environments. X-Body focuses on codified movements, but also links up with live camera, real-time processing in Max/MSP/Jitter and Isadora, and live sound synthesis. Sound direction by [Kat Macdonald][otherkat].
