                  <p>Dear Gillean, </p>
                  <p>As an artist and writer with a passion for open working and the exchange of ideas, the drive of Delfina to foster an environment of community aligns with my own love of collaboration. I believe, with my strong experience working within both communications for an art gallery and for a transgender medical provider, I possess the skill set necessary to support Delfina in its ongoing efforts to engage in the innovative and collaborative creation of art.</p>

            <div class=”post-text-box”>
                  <p>During the launch of The Gender Hormone Clinic, I developed our public-facing communication, graphic design, and marketing strategies. I also designed our call scripts, constructed our website within WordPress (the platform Delfina uses), streamlined patient communications via email, and expanded our industry contacts. Additionally, my role includes a pastoral aspect to how I interacted with both patients and staff. A large quantity of the enquiries we receive are from transgender people travelling to the UK for the first time and trying to navigate accessing their medication while residing here. Having spent my childhood frequently relocating abroad, I understand the challenges of adapting to new environments. I work closely with individuals to help them integrate into the LGBTQIA+ community in the UK and navigate their local health services. </p>

                  <p>During my postgraduate studies in Experimental Music, I developed a keen interest in digital art while developing my practice as a performance artist. I have ideas on how to leverage these skills to create forward-thinking marketing approaches, specifically utilising 3D modelling software in advertising for the foundation’s goal of securing funding to purchase its residence. Additionally, I plan to use my videography expertise to create marketing materials, similar to my work at Nelly Duff Gallery and in my current projects.</p>

                  <p>At Nelly Duff, I assisted in promoting and organizing gallery shows and events. As a smaller print edition gallery, tasks were distributed between staff members evenly, with one of my regular responsibilities being the establishment of connections with local food sellers and breweries to provide refreshments for the events. In addition to this, I worked collaboratively with the head of marketing to generate promotional materials and various paraphernalia for events such as stickers, show guides, pamphlets and vinyls. The thrill and excitement of preparing for shows were my favourite aspects of the role, working as a team towards a distillation of what the gallery represents.</p>

                  <p>My work as a freelance artist, sound designer and writer has given me a diverse set of contacts within the art world, both nationally and internationally. Having worked transatlantically on projects with the Design and Performance Lab and in Europe with my own art practice, I have not just a network, but a drive to work with an international focus on how art can be shared across cultural boundaries. I want to work at Delfina because its culture of fostering a space for artists from across the world to work, eat, share and collaborate, is a cause I truly believe in and strive to be a part of.</p>
