<h2><i><a href="https://otherkat.com/installation/2024-07-14-shedding-at-gallery-puzi%C4%87.html">Multi-Band Excitation: A New Piece For Radio</a></i> with <a href="https://agnescameron.info/">Agnes Cameron</a> at <a href="https://robidacollective.com/projects/academy-of-margins/summer-school-of-the-academy-of-margins-2025">Robida Collective</a>, Topolò (2025)</h2>

*Multi-Band Excitation* is explored in three forms. an electronics workshop and 'hang out' to discuss theory, and an installation. The piece pulls from [Tetsuo Kogawa's][tk] writing and designs for an [FM Transmitter][tkdiagram], Fred Moten and Sefano Harney's [Undercommons][undercommons], Frantz Fanon's [writings on the Voice of Fighting Algeria][vofa] and [Radio Alice's][freealice] philosophy towards pirate radio.

For a full reference library see our [are.na project channel][arena]. The first stage of the piece is the workshop and 'hangout', described [here][workshop]. You can find a description and archival materials of the installation [here][install].

Originally conceived as a new ending to *Peter And The Wolf And The Hedgehog*, an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter And The Wolf by myself and [Agnes Cameron][agnes].

This work reimagines the ending to centre on Peter's growth from a self orientated view of the world to an understanding of his placement within an ecosystem. 

Below is a recording of one of the rehearsals.

*shedding* is a reworking of the piece *shedding femme* from 2021 in collaboration with artist [Agnes Cameron][agnes_cameron]. An examination of the ways in which feminine archetypes around fashion and presentation can entangle and constrain us, even lead us to a lost concept of the self. This piece was currated by [Johannes Birringer][johan] at [Gallery Puzić][galleryp] in Saarbruken, Germany.

[*Mourning for a dead moon*][moon] is multimedia dance work addressing the climate crisis, performed by the [Design and Performance Lab (DAP-Lab)][dap]. During this project I acted as sound and sensory artist, providing an original score and working directly with the dancers to give them creative agency within the piece.

Premiere: December 7, 2019, Artaud Performance Centre, London.

Cutting away pieces of a patchwork connecting old clothes, <i>shedding femme</i> introspectively invited us to consider the selves we are constructed from, and the process of snipping our way free.

The piece took the form of two segments. The first involved the artists performing in solitude, slowly cutting away the fabric. Later in the evening the piece was revisited, allowing the audience to take part in aiding the performer to cut away the patchwork dress.

Throughout the performance a microphone was hung from the ceiling, taking the sounds from the audience and the cuts being made and grandulating the sounds through a custom software called MagSpect built by myself.

She / They / Him (2018) was proposed as an installation piece, taking ideas from Gendered Viewing / Radio and expanding them into a complete and longer work. The piece focused on my personal identity, with my body being an integral part of the work.

*Manipulated Labour* is a devised performance piece exploring the intimacy and interplay between couples falling outside of hetronormative and gender normative forms.
