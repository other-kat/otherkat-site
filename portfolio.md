<h2><i><a href="https://otherkat.com/installation/2024-07-14-shedding-at-gallery-puzi%C4%87.html">Multi-Band Excitation: A New Piece For Radio</a></i> with <a href="https://agnescameron.info/">Agnes Cameron</a> at <a href="https://robidacollective.com/projects/academy-of-margins/summer-school-of-the-academy-of-margins-2025">Robida Collective</a>, Topolò (2025)</h2>

An electronics workshop, theoretical discussion, and installation. Participants co-construct miniature FM transmitters—learning to read schematics, solder components, and generate signals—blurring the boundaries between maker, thinker, and listener. Drawing from [Tetsuo Kogawa’s][tk] DIY radio ethos and [designs][tkdiagram], [the Undercommons][undercommons], Frantz Fanon’s reflections on the [Voice of Fighting Algeria][vofa], and [Radio Alice’s][freealice] pirate media philosophy, the work invites a hands-on interrogation of transmission, agency, and collective intimacy.

For a full reference library see our [are.na project channel][arena]. The first stage of the piece is the workshop and 'hangout', described [here][workshop]. You can find a description and archival materials of the installation [here][install].

<h2><i><a href="https://otherkat.com/installation/2024-07-14-shedding-at-gallery-puzi%C4%87.html">Sympoiesis</a></i> with the <a href="https://peckhamchamberorchestra.co.uk/about">Peckham Chamber Orchestra</a> (2025)</h2>

Originally conceived as a new ending to *Peter And The Wolf And The Hedgehog*, an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter And The Wolf by myself and [Agnes Cameron][agnes].

A reimagined conclusion to Peter and the Wolf, this piece traces Peter's journey toward ecological awareness—“growing from solitude into ecosystemic belonging.” Through orchestral textures, it collapses character and environment into a shared sonic habitat.

Below is a recording of one of the rehearsals.

Since 2024, I’ve led a series of inclusive, experimental presentations and participatory workshops with the London Community Laptop Orchestra—activating laptop-based music making at varied venues and contexts, aimed at collective improvisation and sonic exploration.

A reworking of the 2021 piece *shedding femme*, this new version in collaboration with [Inflationary Assets][ia] probes the constraints of feminine archetypes—fashion as both armor and erasure. In a ritual-like stripping of patchwork, participants dismantle and reconstruct identity. A microphone captures every cut and breath; sound is algorithmically granular via my custom software, **MagSpect**, transforming fabric, texture, and touch into sonic memory.

A multimedia dance work addressing ecological urgency. As sound and sensor designer, I created an original score and embedded creative agency in performers—making visible the frictions between technology, bodies, and planetary grief.

Cutting away pieces of a patchwork connecting old clothes, <i>shedding femme</i> introspectively invited us to consider the selves we are constructed from, and the process of snipping our way free.

The piece took the form of two segments. The first involved the artists performing in solitude, slowly cutting away the fabric. Later in the evening the piece was revisited, allowing the audience to take part in aiding the performer to cut away the patchwork dress.

Throughout the performance a microphone was hung from the ceiling, taking the sounds from the audience and the cuts being made and grandulating the sounds through a custom software called MagSpect built by myself.

<h2><i><a href="https://otherkat.com/installation/2018-09-11-she-/-they-/-he">She / They / He</a></i> at Metafizikel, Artaud Performance Centre (2018)</h2>

She / They / Him (2018) was proposed as an installation piece, taking ideas from Gendered Viewing / Radio and expanding them into a complete and longer work. The piece focused on my personal identity, with my body being an integral part of the work.

*Manipulated Labour* is a devised performance piece exploring the intimacy and interplay between couples falling outside of hetronormative and gender normative forms.
