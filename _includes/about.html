<p>hi! i’m kat, i make sound, performance and visual art. my current work focuses on exploring the politics of art, both through its creation and its interaction with audiences, using an adapted theatre of the oppressed framework. by challenging conventional dynamics between performer and audience, i aims to provoke agency and engagement, enabling the audience to fully realise and engage with a piece’s themes through a dialogical model of performance.</p>
