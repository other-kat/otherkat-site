                  <p>Hi! I’m Kat, a dedicated, hard-working creative, looking for a position in the arts and communications sector. Combined arts is my life with a particular interest in its relations to the philosophy of gender, identity and the creation of artificial environments. I’m a passionate reader and programmer who is always tinkering away on several projects, but in my downtime, I’m an avid lover of cycling, cooking, karaoke, and travel, who never misses an opportunity to dance.</p>
