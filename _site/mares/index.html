        <p><strong>Mares - Residency Application</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Entropy in Flux</em></strong></p>

<p>I care deeply about the politics of art, methodologies of art making and audience / performer dynamics. By challenging conventional dynamics between performer and audience, I aim to provoke agency and engagement, enabling the audience to fully realise and interact with a piece’s themes through a ‘dialogical’(<mark>1</mark>) model of performance. My practice ranges across sound, performance and visual art, with a strong focus on adaptive and generative soundscapes and visuals using sensors.</p>

<p>Currently, my work is exploring the theme of degradation and entropy, through sound and sculptural work, with my most recent piece, <em>shedding</em> (2024) being a durational performance involving the slow disintegration of a 14-metre dress, by both performer and audience in collaboration. For this residency I would like to develop this concept further by creating an ‘audio/ sculptural map’ of areas of Alessandria, combining my current practice, with an archival method, to build a sonic portrait of the local ecological and social landscape.</p>

<p>In writer and filmmaker Hito Steyerl’s 2016 essay, <em>A Tank On A Pedestal</em> (<mark>2</mark>), she questions the role of a museum as a warehouse, investigating questions around an object’s capacity to return to its prior use, or even change use, therefore existing as both a marker of the past and the present simultaneously. I believe this duality can readily be applied to the existence of a ‘ruin’ within a modern context, where something preexisting now operates as infrastructure for something different. Using a similar line of questioning, I aim to explore the existence of a ‘ruin’ as a state in flux, approaching the question of whether a ‘ruin’, really represents an ending of something, or a continuing legacy of change.</p>

<p>During the residency, I want to explore the history of Alessandria through the ways in which it has been rebuilt post human and ecological conflict with a particular focus on the flooding of 1994, looking at the ways in which it has interacted with the existing history and communities of the region. Exploring the people’s relations to the land, architecture and the ways these events have shaped the cultural heterogeneity of the province. During this process I aim to carry out a series of workshops, focusing on listening practices and physical embodiment work with the aim of finding ways of communicating history through physicality.</p>

<p>For the final work, I plan to create a reactive sound installation, representing the province in what scholar Florence M. Hetzler calls “ruin beauty”(<mark>3</mark>), the way in which nature intersects with human-made context. Creating a work that combines archival information, field recording and live sound processing to represent the history of the area, while utilizing the architecture of Santa Croce within the aesthetics of the piece.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.</p>
