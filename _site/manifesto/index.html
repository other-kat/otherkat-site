<p>kat macdonald’s work draws upon a complex tapestry of experiences with trauma, queerness, heartache, social structures, and gender, exploring what it means to exist in a life intertwined with various forms of loss. through performance, sound, visual, and written art, her work challenges audiences to contemplate their own relationship to the art by breaking traditional presentational formats, allowing them a tactile sense of the work and its creation.</p>

<p>kat’s current work focuses on exploring the politics of art, both through its creation and its interaction with audiences, using an adapted theatre of the oppressed framework. by challenging conventional dynamics between performer and audience, she aims to provoke agency and engagement, enabling the audience to fully realise and engage with a piece’s themes through a dialogical model of performance. through this approach, she hopes to create work that critiques current commercial trends of the artist-as-commodity, striving instead for revolutionary art centred on an understanding of the inevitability of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sympoiesis">sympoiesis</a>.</p>

<p>for the past six years, she has served as the resident sound designer and composer for the <a href="https://dap-lab.brunel.ac.uk/arch.html">design and performance lab</a> under the direction of choreographer and designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Birringer">johannes birringer</a>. during this period, she has developed and utilised custom software (and occasionally hardware) of her own design to create adaptive and reactive soundscapes. currently, kat leads the <a href="https://lclo.otherkat.com/">london community laptop orchestra</a>, an all-abilities, community-organised laptop orchestra, rehearsing in public spaces around london.</p>
