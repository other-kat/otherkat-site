<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>

<p>I was looking to visit but was concerned about the accessibility of your facilities with regards to the recent announcements made by the EHRC.</p>

<p>They state “trans women should not be permitted to use the women’s facilities and trans men should not be permitted to use the men’s facilities” and “in some circumstances the law also allows trans women not to be permitted to use the men’s facilities, and trans men not to be permitted to use the women’s facilities”.</p>

<p>This guidance, violates the Equaility Act of 2010 and could lead to violence and harassment of trans+ people within these spaces.</p>

<p>I just wanted to hear your thoughts on the matter and make sure that your spaces are trans accessible? Additionally, it would be great to see this information made more easily accessible.</p>

<p>Kindest Regards,</p>
