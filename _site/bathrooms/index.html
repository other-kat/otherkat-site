        <h1><i>bathrooms (study)</i></h1>

<p>By <a href="https://otherkat.com">Kat Macdonald</a></p>

<p>Written in response to the Supreme Court ruling and statements made by the UK government with regards to trans+ peoples access to bathrooms</p>

<p>Stage works in the public bathrooms of institutions that refuse to make statements or make their bathrooms accessible to transgender people.</p>

<p>These works can take the form of <u>photography</u>, <u>performance art</u>, <u>concerts</u>, <u>digital art</u>, <u>web art</u>, <u>exhibitions</u>, <u>posters</u>, <u>literary works</u> and <u>fine art</u>. Within these works there must be a meaningful engagement with the space, either politically, architecturally or conceptually. I am less interested in works that don’t present a conflict with these spaces.</p>

<p>Anyone can partake in this study, with an encouragement for cis participants to focus on riskier disruptive actions, centering the institution as the core audience.</p>

<p>Each work (post evaluation (carried out by an open committee of trans+ artists) that it meets criteria) will be catalogued and archived in the bathroom study archive.</p>

<p><mark>Prompts</mark></p>

<p>Host a concert in a bathroom.</p>

<p>Turn a bathroom into an installation.</p>

<p>Write speculative fiction about bathrooms.</p>

<p>Hold an exhibition in a bathrooms.</p>

<p>Gather people within a bathroom.</p>

<p>Occupy a bathroom to prevent standard use.</p>

<p><mark>Reminders</mark></p>

<p>Make sure that distruptive actions in public bathrooms, don’t affect access to those who need it or target insitutions that ensure trans accessibility. Occupying a bathroom should never prevent access but encourage it. Disruption should be targetted at the instutions upkeep of a ‘comfortable’ environment, where this contrasts with the inclusivity of the space.</p>
