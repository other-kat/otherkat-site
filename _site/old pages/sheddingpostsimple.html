               <p><b>reception</b></p>
               <p>The piece was a success! With a rough attendance of 35-40 people in person and an undetermined number on the live stream, it had a pretty good turn out with some great audience feedback. We had a really mixed audience who, for the most part, happily got involved joining in with the cutting and found the piece to be mediative and beautiful to watch.</p>
               <p>It lasted just a fraction under time, ending after approximately 170  minutes, before hanging in the space for an additional hour. It's always hard to judge performance works with how long they'll end up lasting but apparently the work could have gone on longer.</p>
               <p>Part way through I had a moment of realisation that the main draw of the piece was its nature as an evolving sculptural work thats best witnessed in small repeated instances over its run time. It complimented the gallery it was set in fairly well.</p>

                  <p><b>considerations</b></p>
                  <p>Agnes did an incredible job on the dresses design. From what started as me fumbling with fabric the Sunday before the show, she marshalled it into a beautiful structure that looked just <b>phenomenal</b> in the space. Additionally the dress packed down so easily for transport. Next time I promise to give you more time!</p>
                  <p>The cloth was a struggle to hang due to the galleries high ceilings and a lack of infrastructure to support the weight. In the end we decided on a rigging system to suspend the piece freely allowing it to move with me during the performance. This actually worked a treat and added to the general mystique, rather than the very boxy image I initially had.</p>
                  <p>Once it was up, it flowed beautifully with audience members comparing it to the movement of a sail in the wind. It twisted gorgeously around my form as I moved and made for a perfect performance tool.</p>

                  <p><b>theoretics</b></p>
                  <p>The piece is an obvious homage to the work of Yoko Ono's Cut Piece but with an inverse of thematic direction. With Cut Piece, the clothes were an armour and a sense of safety that were being stripped away, the audience were clawing for a sense of the imtimacy with the artist, a wish to truely know her.  With <i>shedding</i>, I was looking to do the inverse. I wanted to invite the audience to free me, from a prison of cloth.</p>
                  <p>At a few moments, I had a realisation that what I'd created for myself was more of a panopticon than a shell, where at all moments I was being obveserved but through which I was totally unable to see more than silhouettes of my audience.</p>
                  <p>My mental state while in the structure was fragile, all I could hear was sounds; words, movement, camera shutters, movement of cloth, cars passing the open door of the gallery, the sound elements and breathing. It was highlighted with a self concious panic at times. I felt isolated from the room, while also its focal point.

                  <p><b>thanks</b></p>
                  <p>I want to directly thank my collaborator <b>Inflationary Assets (Agnes Cameron)</b>, without her this piece wouldn't have come together in the way that it did. She was so integral to this piece and takes just as much credit as me for how well this went. Love you always.</p>
                  <p><b>Johannes</b>! We've been working together for quite sometime now and I always mavel at the energy and enthusiam he brings to projects. His willness to get stuck in with both helping set up and providing equipment, took the stress out of the process of working approad.
                  <p><b>Gallery Puzić</b> - thank you so much for hosting me, advertising hard for this show and making sure I had what I needed from the space and while staying in Saarbrüken. So much love for the energy and goodwill for the thought you put in and engaging so readily with the piece.</p>
                  <p><b>Michéle</b> - it was so lovely chatting through ideas with you before going and your way of thinking about performance design always inspires the way I make work.</p>
                  <p>Also thanks to my flatmate and new friend <b>Raymond</b> for both being great company and for coming and getting stuck in for the entire run of the installation! So sweet and you are always welcome at mine in London.</p>
