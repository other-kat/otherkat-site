               <p>A piece exploring the ways in which we haunt ourselves. This work was conceived from 3 core inspiration points; Beyond Black by Hilary Mantel - a rather mundane and everyday lense into the idea of spirits and haunting, Ohiyo by Satoshi Kon - a one-minute short film that uses transparency layers to convey one character going about an almost exactly similar daily wake up routine and the work of photographer Daido Moriyama - who's use of contrast and saturation, creates a clautraphobic tightness to his photography.</p>
               <p>The audio for the work is generated by the manipulation of two core samples, one being from my undergraduate dissertation piece and the other being from my postgraduate dissertation piece, as well as the introduction of some recent samples. This brings the theme of 'haunting' full circle, with my past artistic works haunting my current work.</p>
