        <h1><i>A Case For The Erosion Of Gender</i></h1>

<p>The meta text of the recent announment is clear “the nail that sticks out, gets hammered down”. Get in line or fear public exclusion. What this announcement wqill likely lead to for many, is de-transition and a return to the closet, a move that proves the conservative view of trans confusion right. This empowers a further erosion of access to trans healthcare via the statistical disproval of transness being a permanent state, an argument thats been key to discussion of medical access for decades.</p>

<p>Its imperative we remain a tight grip on our transness while pivoting fully to an argument for transness as a transient state of gender with no platues or fixed positions. Transness exists in motion, a state in perpetual flux. We must all exist in a fluid embrace of genderlessness. Our movement should encourage all to be non-binary. It’s now become critical that the removal of gender is a political position, one which any can and must join, till a critical mass is achieved. A breaking point upon which culture must change to accomodate our positions and our identity.</p>

<p>We must abandon calls of gender appropriation and tests of legitimacy. Transness MUST be adopted by all. It must abandon ties to the aesthetic. The artist must be revived. Intent of gender must be key beyond its engagement with its audience.</p>

<p>They wish for a return to the closet. We must bring the closet to them and open the door.</p>
