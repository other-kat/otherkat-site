                  <p>kat macdonald’s work pulls upon a complex tapestry of experience with trauma, queerness, heartache, social structures and gender, exploring what it means to exist as a life intertwined with different forms of loss. through the medium of performance, sound, visual and written art, her work challenges an audience to contemplate their own relation to the art by decoupling traditional presentational formats, allowing an audience to get a tactile sense of a work and its creation. </p>

                  <p>kat’s current work focuses on how we, as artists, both heal and hurt ourselves, with a particular focus on the ways in which we can create engaging and raw work while holding ourselves accountable for the perpetuation of self-damaging behaviours through our art. she hopes that through accountability, we can develop healthier systems of developing trauma-informed work, without limiting the content of the work, to sanitised ‘moralistic’ ideals. </p>
                  <p>for the past 6 years, she has worked as the resident sound designer and composer for the Design and Performance Lab under the direction of choreographer and designer Johannes Birringer. during this period kat worked in a variety of different roles, often providing and utilising custom software (and occasionally hardware) of her own design to create adaptive and reactive soundscapes. </p>
