hi! i'm [kat][kat-website], i make sound, performance and visual art. my current work focuses on exploring the politics of art, both through its creation and its interaction with audiences, using an adapted [theatre of the oppressed][toto] framework. by challenging conventional dynamics between performer and audience, i aims to provoke agency and engagement, enabling the audience to fully realise and engage with a pieceâ€™s themes through a dialogical model of performance.

for the past six years, i've worked as the resident sound designer and composer for the [design and performance lab][dap] under the direction of choreographer and designer [johannes birringer][johan]. during this period, i developed and utilised custom software (and occasionally hardware) of my own design to create adaptive and reactive soundscapes. currently, i run the [london community laptop orchestra][lclo], an all-abilities, community-organised laptop orchestra, rehearsing in public spaces around london.
