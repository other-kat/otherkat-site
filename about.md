hi! I'm [kat][kat-website], i make sound, performance and visual art. my work focuses on how, as artists, we both heal and hurt ourselves, with a particular focus on the ways in which we can create engaging and raw work while holding ourselves accountable for the perpetuation of self-damaging behaviours through our art.
