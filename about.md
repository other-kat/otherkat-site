hi! i'm [kat][kat-website], i care deeply about the politics of art, methodologies of art making and audience / performer dynamics. by challenging conventional roles of audience and performer, i aim to provoke agency and engagement, enabling the audience to fully realise and interact with a piece’s themes through a ‘dialogical’ model of performance. my practice ranges across sound, performance and visual art, with a strong focus on adaptive and generative soundscapes and visuals using sensors.

i've worked as the resident sound designer and composer for the [design and performance lab][dap] under the direction of choreographer and designer [johannes birringer][johan], designing custom software and working with wearable sensors.

my current practice explores themes of degradation and entropy, through sound and sculptural work, with my most recent performance piece, [shedding (2024)][shed], being a durational performance involving the slow disintegration of a 14-metre dress, by both performer and audience in collaboration.

additionally, i have been exploring methods and techniques for scoring and choreography, investigating ways of communicating musical ideas in ways that allow for broader creative interpretations.

i run the [london community laptop orchestra][lclo], an all-abilities, community-organised laptop orchestra, rehearsing in public spaces around london.
