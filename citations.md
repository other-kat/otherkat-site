kat : i use a freeform method of citation that is attempting to communication no greater or lesser importance as it would be impossibly to truely account for one influence over another. the names begin from those listed on my collaborators page and then stretch further.

**this page will always be a work in progress**

**additionally, in a commitment to accuracy, the citations listed here are not endorsements of the entirity of an mentioned artists work. while i can strongly disagree with someone's politics, their citation remains important in upholding transparency and accuracy**
