**Kat Macdonald's** work focuses on the sympoeitic relations nested within both natural and technological systems, looking at the formation of agency within engagement with art, to create personal and intimate narratives.

**Having received her MA in Experimental Music** from Brunel University in 2018, she has gone on to make work both within collectives and independantly, having worked as the resident sound and sensor artist for the [Design And Performance Lab][dap] between 2017 - 2022 under the direction of choreographer and designer [Johannes Birringer][johan] designing custom sound and visual software and working with wearable sensors.

**Making between disaplines,** Kat works with sound, digital visuals, the web, scuptural work, choreography, scoring and performance, in addition to site-specific installations in both the UK and Europe. **Her work has been shown** at festivals such as DRNA, Intimidades Públicas, ICNOVA and more.

**Her current practice explores** themes of degradation and entropy, through sound and sculptural work, looking at the act of collective unmaking as a form of liberatory vulnerability. 

**She run's the [London Community Laptop Orchestra][lclo] (2024 - ),** an all-abilities, community-organised laptop orchestra, inspired by groups such as the 1969 - 1974 Scratch Orchestra, with a focus on graphic and text based scores.
