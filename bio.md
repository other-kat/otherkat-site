**Kat Macdonald's** work focuses on the sympoeitic relations nested within both natural and technological systems, looking at the formation of agency within engagement with art, to create personal and intimate narratives.

**Having received her MA in Experimental Music** from Brunel University in 2018, she has gone on to make work both within collectives and independantly, having worked as the resident sound and sensor artist for the [Design And Performance Lab][dap] between 2017 - 2022 under the direction of choreographer and designer [Johannes Birringer][johan] designing custom sound and visual software and working with wearable sensors.

**Making between disciplines,** Kat works with sound, digital visuals, the web, scuptural work, choreography, scoring and performance, in addition to site-specific installations in both the UK and Europe. **Her work has been shown** at festivals such as DRNA, Intimidades Públicas, ICNOVA and more.

**Her current practice explores** our engagements with space, both public and private, looking at the ways in which privatisation has affected our capcity for self-expression and protest. 

**She runs the [London Community Laptop Orchestra][lclo] (2024 - ),** an all-abilities, community-organised laptop orchestra, inspired by groups such as the 1969 - 1974 [Scratch Orchestra][scratch], with a focus on [guerrilla performances][guerrilla], using the laptop as a tool for collective creative engagement.

**She has worked as** an artist, a technician, a chef, a sales assistant, a social media manager, a bartender, an art handler, a communications manager, in IT, in conveince stores, in cafes, in galleries, in nightclubs, in advertising, in offices, out of offices, in the field, in the studio, in the garden and internationally.
